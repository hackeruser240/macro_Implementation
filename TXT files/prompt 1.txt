scenario: 

i am trying to inject and run a VBA script in MS word. I am trying to implement it in python. 

suppose there are multiple files in a directory with the extension '.docm'. for every file, the function applyFormatting() will run, after which its PDF will be generated and saved in a separate directory.

problem:

when the first file comes in, applyFormatting() will run, the macro defined in the 'macro_file' text file is saved in a 'Normal.docm' template file (which MS Word automatically generates and maintains). Everything runs smoothly and the first file completes its execution. By the way, the name of the macro is "DirectCertifyQA".

Now, when the second file comes, it immediately pauses the execution. The reason is because when it attempts to inject 'DirectCertifyQA' in the second file, it throws an error which tells a macro with the same name is already present in the 'Normal.docm' file (because of the first file). This causes the python execution to crash.

for your reference, I am attaching snippets of code to let you know the code and a file named 'Macro_DirectCertifyQA' that has the DirectCertifyQA macro.
Now, what to do here? What are the possible solutions here? What are the ways out?
